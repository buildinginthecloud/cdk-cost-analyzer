# CDK Cost Analyzer Configuration
# This file configures cost thresholds and usage assumptions for cost analysis

# Cost thresholds for pipeline enforcement
thresholds:
  default:
    warning: 50   # USD per month - displays warning but passes pipeline
    error: 200    # USD per month - fails pipeline, requires review

# Custom usage assumptions for cost estimation
# Adjust these values to match your expected application usage
usageAssumptions:
  # Amazon S3 usage patterns
  s3:
    storageGB: 100           # Expected storage size in GB
    getRequests: 50000       # Monthly GET requests
    putRequests: 5000        # Monthly PUT requests
    dataTransferGB: 50       # Monthly data transfer out in GB

  # AWS Lambda usage patterns
  lambda:
    invocationsPerMonth: 1000000  # Monthly function invocations
    averageDurationMs: 200        # Average execution duration in milliseconds
    memoryMB: 512                 # Allocated memory in MB

  # Amazon DynamoDB usage patterns
  # For on-demand (pay-per-request) billing mode
  dynamodb:
    readRequestsPerMonth: 10000000   # Monthly read requests (on-demand mode)
    writeRequestsPerMonth: 1000000   # Monthly write requests (on-demand mode)
  # Note: For provisioned billing mode, costs are calculated from ReadCapacityUnits
  # and WriteCapacityUnits specified in the CloudFormation template

  # Amazon API Gateway usage patterns
  apiGateway:
    requestsPerMonth: 1000000  # Monthly API requests

# CDK synthesis configuration (optional)
synthesis:
  appPath: .                 # Path to CDK application
  outputPath: cdk.out        # CDK synthesis output directory

# Resource exclusions (optional)
# Exclude specific resource types from cost analysis
exclusions:
  resourceTypes:
    - AWS::IAM::Role         # IAM roles have no direct cost
    - AWS::IAM::Policy       # IAM policies have no direct cost
    - AWS::Logs::LogGroup    # CloudWatch Logs analyzed separately

# Cache configuration
cache:
  enabled: true              # Enable pricing data caching
  durationHours: 24          # Cache duration in hours
